- **Course Title: ASP.NET Core 8**
- **Project-01: Medicine Shop Application Development**

## Overview

This project aims to develop a simplified medicine shop application similar to [Arogga](https://www.arogga.com/). The application will focus primarily on the core functionalities of buying and selling medicines. It will cater to users looking to search for medicines based on their name or generic name, add selected medicines to a cart, and complete transactions seamlessly. The application will also allow users to search for products by categories like eye care, diabetes, pressure management, ENT, dental, etc. Upon completing transactions, users will receive invoices and delivery information.

## Objectives

1. **Develop an intuitive search functionality** to allow users to search for medicines using the medicine name, generic name, or category.
2. **Display detailed product information** including images, descriptions, prices, and generic names.
3. **Implement a cart feature** for users to add desired products for purchase.
4. **Facilitate seamless transactions** allowing users to pay for their selected products.
5. **Generate invoices and delivery information** for users upon successful payment.
